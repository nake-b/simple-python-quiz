# Simple Python Quiz

This project is just something I coded up in a few hours for my first github repo. I used tkinter for the UI, and [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API for the quiz questions. The image resources are from the Udemy course [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
